# Content Guidelines

## Guidelines

1. All submitted content must be free. Should content that is submitted ever become paid in any way, shape, or form, that content will be subject to removal. If you, as a user of the site, encounter content that is no longer free, please report this to a staff member.
2. Content posted must be _legally_ free. Illegal/pirated content will be removed/rejected. Content that can be earned such as via completing activities that are also free is also permitted. So 
3. Unless in a specific guiding order, all content will be organized alphabetically. 
4. All times must be posted in UTC.
