# Mission Statement

Purpose: To make learning information security in all of its facets attainable by collecting and organizing free resources available online. Content would be organized and tagged appropriately to create educational tracks of collected materials. Additional considerations include:

* Collecting materials that may be used as study prep for things such as the OSCP
  * Exam reviews/course/content reviews would also be accepted
* Materials would eventually have a rating system to see how helpful users found them to be
* Long term goal: Add sections per language with different curators, accessibility options as well
* The InfoSec Librarians Guild is an organization agnostic group that seeks solely to collect information and benefit infosec as a whole. Preference to individual sites and resources will be avoided where possible.
